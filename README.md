Program 1: Even or Odd Checker

This program, task1.py, prompts the user for an integer. It then uses an if-else statement combined with the modulo operator (%) to determine if the entered number is even or odd. The result is then printed to the console, clearly stating whether the number is even or odd.

Program 2: Sum of Integers

The second program, task2.py, calculates the sum of all integers from 1 to 50. It achieves this by using a for loop to iterate through the numbers in this range and incrementally adding each number to a running total. Finally, the program prints the total sum. This serves as a practical demonstration of how to use loops for cumulative calculations.
